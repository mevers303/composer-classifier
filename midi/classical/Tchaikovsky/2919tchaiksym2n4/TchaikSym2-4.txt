   This sequence is of the finale of Tchaikovsky's 2nd
Symphony, based on Ukrainian themes. It was sequenced for the
Proteus 2 sound module, using a Korg O3R/W for its GM tuba patch.

   All tracks have been transposed to concert pitch.
     
   String sections share their corresponding MIDI channel
with program changes between bowed and pizzicato strings.

   Please note that bars 342-357 of the Tremolo Strings
track play a Pizzicato Violins; this was done because some of the
violins are playing a bowed passage at the same time.
