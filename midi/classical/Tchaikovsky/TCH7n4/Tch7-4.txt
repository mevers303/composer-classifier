This sequence is a re-creation from the orchestral parts of the finale of Semyon
Bogatyrev's reconstruction of Tchaikovsky's planned 7th
symphony. It was produced for the Proteus 2 Orchestral sound
module and the Korg O3R/W orchestral sound module.

It closesly follows the music of the Finale of Tchaikovsky's
Adagio and Finale for Piano and Orchestra, which I have also
sequenced.
